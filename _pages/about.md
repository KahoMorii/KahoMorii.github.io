Welcome to Kaho Morii's website! <br>
I am a CfA fellow at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithonian. 
<br>
My research interest is star formation, especially high-mass stars. 
Using the radio interferometers such as ALMA, SMA, and VLA, I'm studying the initial phase of high-mass star formation in infrared dark clouds (IRDCs).
