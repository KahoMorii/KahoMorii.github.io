Welcome to Kaho Morii's website! I am a PhD student studying astronomy at the University of Tokyo, Japan.

My research interest is star formation, especially about high-mass stars. 
Using the radio interferometer such as ALMA, I'm studying the initial phase of high-mass star formation in infrared dark clouds (IRDCs).
